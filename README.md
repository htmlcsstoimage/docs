## Development Environment
The HTMLCSSToImage Documentation site is built as a static site using Jekyll and served through [Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-sites/). To set up a local development environment, follow the steps below:
1. If required, install Ruby on your machine.
2. Install the required Ruby gems by running the following command:
```bash
bundle install
```
3. Start the local development server with live reload by executing the following command:
```bash
HCTI_API_KEY=key bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
During development, you can set a dummy value for `HCTI_API_KEY`.

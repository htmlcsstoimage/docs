{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<hr>

If you have feature requests, please send them to us: support@htmlcsstoimage.com.

### Single-Request Image Generation endpoint
June 15, 2025
{: .text-delta}

We've released a powerful new endpoint that allows you to generate images from HTML/CSS in a single request using signed URLs. This new [create-and-render endpoint](/getting-started/create-and-render/) eliminates the need for the traditional two-step process of creating an image and then fetching it.

Key benefits include:
- **Client-side friendly**: Generate image URLs without exposing your API key
- **No POST requests**: Skip the image creation step and go straight to rendering
- **HMAC authentication**: Secure signed URLs prevent unauthorized usage
- **Direct image response**: URLs return images immediately when accessed

This endpoint is perfect for scenarios where you need to generate image URLs from client-side code or want to simplify your image generation workflow. The endpoint uses HMAC SHA256 authentication to ensure security while keeping your API key private.

<hr>

### DPI query param
December 18, 2024
{: .text-delta}

We've added a new query param `dpi` which allows you to set the DPI metadata tag on your generated image. For example `hcti.io/v1/image/123abc?dpi=300`.
This only sets the metadata tag, you must still create an image large enough for the needed DPI.

<hr>

### Learn how to make a downloadable image
December 20, 2023
{: .text-delta}

Did you know? You can make your image downloadable by adding `?dl=1` to the end of the URL. Learn more here: [dl param](/parameters/dl/)

<hr>

### New ms_delay and device_scale guides
November 19, 2023
{: .text-delta}

We've added new pages with detailed information on how to better use ms_delay and device_scale.

1. [ms_delay](/parameters/ms_delay/)
2. [device_scale](/parameters/device_scale/)

<hr>

### Getting account usage
April 12, 2023
{: .text-delta}

We've added a new page explaining how to [grab your account usage](/guides/account-usage) via the API. 

<hr>

### Invoice improvements
June 18, 2022
{: .text-delta}

The invoice page has been upgraded. You can now view all of your invoices, download a PDF, and make payments
on any overdue invoices.

<hr>

### Integromat integration is now called Make
June 1, 2022
{: .text-delta}

FYI - Integromat has rebranded to Make. We have updated all our links and documentation to now point to Make.

<hr>
### ms_delay improvements
May 18, 2022
{: .text-delta}

This has been a much requested feature!

We have increased the `ms_delay` limit to 20 seconds (20,000ms). Usage above 5000ms does cost an additional image render credit.
For example, using `ms_delay` of 10000ms on an image will count as 2 images towards your monthly quota.

This is useful for pages with very slow load times, such as metrics dashboards. We hope you find it useful!

<hr>

### Dashboard improvements
November 21, 2021
{: .text-delta}

We have added a `usage` endpoint to the API. This exposes the amount of images your account has created in hourly, daily and monthly rollups. [Learn more](/getting-started/using-the-api#checking-account-usage).


### Dashboard improvements
October 29, 2021
{: .text-delta}

We released several improvements to the dashboard and invoices based on your feedback.

<hr>
### Large image performance improvements
July 23, 2021

<hr>
### Hebrew character set updated
April 24, 2021
{: .text-delta}

You can also create images using URL's from the console. Click the Options tab to see the new url field.

<hr>
### Improvements to transparency rendering
February 16, 2021
{: .text-delta}

<a href="/guides/transparent-background/">Background transparency</a> now also works for images generated from URLs. To do it, pass the following code in your CSS param.

```
body {
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

Note: this will only work for PNG's. Jpeg's do not support transparency.

<hr>
### Demo and example pages now include an options tab
February 4, 2021
{: .text-delta}

We updated the live demo to be even more configurable. Now you can adjust all the options on an image when testing.

We also improved the error messages for when you run into a problem.

<hr>

### Inject custom CSS into a webpage
December 22, 2020
{: .text-delta}

When using [URL to Image](/getting-started/url-to-image), you can now inject CSS into the page. This is useful for cases where you want to customize your screenshot of the page. Allowing you to do things like hide specific elements on the page
(such as annoying popups or cookie banners). To get started with it, pass along the css param when using URL to image. This is now available on Zapier and soon will also be working for Integromat.

### Zapier integration updated to 1.0.7
December 20, 2020
{: .text-delta}

We've released a new version of the Zapier integration. It now gives you even more configuration options when creating images. For URL images, you'll now see a CSS field. This allows you to inject CSS into the webpage.
Making it easy to customize how the page looks.

We have also added the `selector` field to the normal Create image action. This allows you to target a specific CSS selector in your HTML and we'll crop the image to that element.

### Improvements to image deletion
December 13, 2020
{: .text-delta}

We've improved image deletion. Previously, images might take several minutes to be uncached and deleted everywhere. Now they are removed almost instantly. For more information, learn how to 
[delete an image](/getting-started/using-the-api/#deleting-an-image).


<hr>
### Full screen parameter added to Integromat
November 13, 2020

Integromat now has the full_screen parameter available. When set to true the entire height of the page will be included in the image.

<hr>
### Ruby client update
October 2, 2020
{: .text-delta}

We released a patch update to the [HTML/CSS to Image Ruby Client](https://github.com/htmlcsstoimage/ruby-client). It fixes an issue with 
`addressable` not being loaded.

<hr>
### Font rendering improvements
September 30, 2020
{: .text-delta}

We have released a large update to the fonts available to the API. Previously, we were missing some character sets and some images would show an
empty square instead of the correct character. Our goal is to be able to perfectly render text from any language.

If you notice any more missing characters, please send us the image URL so that we can investigate it.

<hr>
### Various performance improvements released
September 10, 2020
{: .text-delta}

We've been working on further improving the performance of the API. Initial image renders are now ~30% faster. We have also improved caching of images.
When cached, you can expect an average of 30-50ms when downloading an image.

<hr>
### Zapier plugin released from beta!
August 31, 2020
{: .text-delta}
The HTML/CSS to Image Zapier integration has graduated from beta. Zapier wrote up a [nice blog post about the integration](https://zapier.com/blog/updates/2370/new-integration-htmlcss-image).
It's become very popular quickly and we've seen many inventive ways people are improving their businesses through automated image generation.

### Template API
July 27, 2020
{: .text-delta}
The Template API is now available. With templates, you can create re-usable HTML that contains variables.
These variables can be replaced when creating an image, making for even simpler image generation.

- [HTML/CSS to Image Template API](/getting-started/templates/)

<hr>

### Render when ready
July 26, 2020
{: .text-delta}
We have added the [`render_when_ready` parameter to image creation](/guides/render-when-ready/). This gives you control over when the image is rendered.

By setting `render_when_ready` to `true`, we will wait to generate the image until your HTML calls the `ScreenshotReady()` function in JavaScript.

This is useful for images that have complex JS and you need control over when it's ready to have an image created.

<hr>

### New Zapier templates
July 22, 2020
{: .text-delta}
We have added additional Zapier templates to the integration. You can see them here: [HTML/CSS to Image Templates](https://zapier.com/apps/htmlcss-to-image/integrations#zap-template-list).

<hr>

### Introducing the US-EAST region
July 7, 2020
{: .text-delta}
We have enabled our US-EAST region. Your API requests will now be automatically routed to either US-WEST or US-EAST based on where you ae located.
This will improve latency for requests as well as reliability of the API. We will automatically fail over to the other region is one is unhealthy.

We plan to introduce an EU region in the future.

<hr>

### Brand new docs site
July 5, 2020
{: .text-delta}
We've released a new version of our documentation website. It's now simpler, faster & we've improved the organization of all the content.
Please send us any feedback.

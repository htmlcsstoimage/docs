## AI assistants

Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to generate images directly from your AI coding assistant. Describe what you want in natural language, and let the AI handle the rest.

| Integration | Supported tools | Description |
|:------------|:----------------|:------------|
| **[MCP Server](/integrations/mcp/)** | Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cline, Zed, OpenCode | Generate images by chatting with your AI assistant. No code needed—just describe the image you want. |

### How it works

1. Connect the MCP server to your AI assistant
2. Describe the image you want: *"Create a social card for my blog post about TypeScript"*
3. The AI generates HTML/CSS and calls the API for you
4. Get back a ready-to-use image URL

This is the fastest way to prototype designs, create one-off images, or explore what's possible with the API.

## Need a custom integration?

The HTML/CSS to Image API is a simple REST API that works with any platform capable of making HTTP requests. If your tool supports webhooks or custom API calls, you can integrate directly.
